## Summary
An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on a remote machine in the same network via a spoofed master server.

## Details
An attacker can add and execute new backup tasks when the master server is spooofed (via Man-in-the-Middle). The commands are executed using the pre-backup events defined in a new task.

## Impact
An attacker can execute arbitrary commands in a target machine.

## Recommendation
This software has no support since 2014, so this vulnerability will not be fixed.
